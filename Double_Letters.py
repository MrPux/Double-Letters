#   Analyze a string to check if it contains two of the same letter in a row.
#   E.g, "Hello" has 'l' twice in a row, 
#   while the string "nono" does not have two identical letters in a row.

#   Function must return 'True' if there are two identical letters in a row in the string,
    #and 'False' otherwise
